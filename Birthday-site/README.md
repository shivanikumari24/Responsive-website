#  BIRTHDAY WEBSITE 

This website is designed to be a fun and interactive way to celebrate someone's birthday. It features a responsive design, meaning that it can adapt to different screen sizes and devices, making it easy to view on a desktop computer, tablet, or mobile phone.


#  Project Description

Welcome to my first project. In this lesson I'll introduce the birthday page , which will utilize HTML5; media queries; flexible images; CSS, and much more.

#  Difference between desktop & mobile version 

Compare the difference between the desktop and mobile version of our festive birthday invitation: 

<img alt="" width="800" src="images/View_Screen.jpg">

Notice how on the mobile (lefthand) version, the image and information are centered for easy access, while the wider desktop version has room for extra imagery and different alignment configurations, with the unicorn to the left of the text.

Coding for the least common denominator - coding mobile first - lets you think philosophically about how to make your site as simple and legible as possible. From that solid baseline, you can expand out and get fancier on the web. 

So, go code! You can find all the necessary text in the read.me. Play around placing it inside the div container for the body!
